        reaching up, touching down for string quartet (Winter 2015)	– Chin Ting Chan

        reaching up, touching down is written for the RTHK Quartet to be premiered in the SOUND-IMAGination: Hong Kong Landscape project in the HKICC Lee Shau Kee School of Creativity, as one of the commissioned pieces by the Hong Kong Composers’ Guild. The project explores and fosters relationships between sound and image inspired by the modern cityscape of Hong Kong.

        This piece explores different perspectives of Hong Kong’s cityscape, particularly of the perspective looking from below. It is inspired by an image by photographer Wong Mei-yin. The image portrays a person lying on a rooftop amid city noise, facing up against the sunshine but with the face covered. The music re-imagines and vitalizes the sound world surrounding the subject, as though the collage of city noise uncovers his/her face, rising up to above and beyond the infinite layers of Hong Kong’s modern cityscape. The image is projected to a large screen during the premiere.


        Friction for string trio (Fall 2015) 					– Chin Ting Chan

        Friction is the force created by sliding objects against each other. It results in the conversion of kinetic energy into thermal energy. Inspired by this idea, this piece treats sounds as “objects” and attempts to create friction that would fuse energy into the sound wave. To create friction, the music focuses on building up tension with sounds that go in contrary or oblique motions, mimicking the concept of physical friction. The tension is then released when the sounds go in parallel motion. Ultimately, it forms an illusion of sonic friction.


        Cross-currents for solo violin (Fall 2015) 				– Chin Ting Chan

        The term “cross-currents” refers to currents in a river that flows across other currents. The flow of water in these currents is highly unstable, shifting course constantly. To provoke images of such abstract concepts, this piece uses juxtapositions of conflicting materials as well as quick registral displacements of melodic lines. The idea of water flowing to unpredictable and overlapping directions guides this music to adventurous terrains.

        This piece was jointly commissioned by the Missouri Music Teachers Association (MMTA) and Music Teachers National Association (MTNA) as part of the MTNA Composer Commissioning Program. It was written for violinist Yu-Fang Chen for a premiere at the 2015 MMTA state conference in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.


        Cross-strings for violin and viola (Summer 2015)			– Chin Ting Chan

        This piece is adapted from “Crosswind” for flute and alto saxophone (2013), where the original program notes read,

        “Crosswind is a piece full of interactivity and energy. Both parts feature intricate gestures and timbral varieties that not only stimulate conversations, but also create a complex overall texture. While the two players sometimes complement each other, they are occasionally in conflict, each fighting for being the lead. To explore this idea of conflict and harmony, this piece alternates between materials that are vertically harmonious and vertically inharmonious, thus forming a progression of tension and release, as well as a collective sonority that is constantly developing, and often unexpected.”


        Rituals for fixed media (Spring 2015)				– Chin Ting Chan

        Rituals is inspired by various ritual processes of different cultures. Some rituals involve elaborate processes, while others are simply daily rituals inherited from the tradition. While most rituals are diversely different, they all engage a sequence of actions according to a prescribed order guided by a mythical belief. This piece takes inspirations and sonic elements reminiscent of the ritual processes and forms a sonic collage that alternates constantly between hyper-real and surreal soundscapes, and creates a multi-layered texture of timbral and rhythmic complexity. Some of the sound sources include air, wind chimes, metals, water, piano resonance and various drum patterns, processed almost exclusively with Cycling 74’s Max program.


        Thread for violin duet	 (Winter 2015)					– Chin Ting Chan

        Thread is commissioned by violinist Yu-Fang Chen and written while in residence at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts. The title “thread” refers to the smallest sequence or chain of operations in computer programming. Multiple threads can exist simultaneously to form more complex operations that are interrelated. These concepts are then translated to the layering of the music and ultimately form its ongoing burst of energy.


        Flurry for solo piano (Winter 2015)					– Chin Ting Chan

        Commissioned by pianist Kari Johnson and written while in residence with the Charlotte Street Foundation, this piece is inspired by the visions of looking through a window covered by layers of snow flurries. Parts of the layers are melted by sunshine and starting to form ice crystals. While they block and reflect lights in different ways, the other parts welcome new flurries to repopulate the surface. These masks of white change constantly, and create interesting shapes and patterns. After a while, they seem to make logical sense, and I realize only nature can create such levels of complexity in randomness.


        Axis for clarinet in B-flat, violin and viola (Fall-Winter 2014)	– Chin Ting Chan

        Commissioned by clarinetist Pei-Lun Tsai and written while in residence with the Charlotte Street Foundation, this piece treats the ensemble like one instrument, blending the sounds and paying particular attention to how each of them is able to shape the entity of the ensemble sound. The piece provokes an imaginary axis in the middle of the ensemble setup. This creates an interesting spatial effect - an evolving sound world that constantly shifts left and right, front and back as though they are echoing sounds in a resonant space. This idea originates from the composer’s intention of creating an imaginary pivot point that pushes and pulls, and balances a moving momentum, much like a tilting doll (tumbler). The idea is also prominent in the choice of the pitch materials.


        Shape of Wind for solo violin (Summer 204) 			– Chin Ting Chan

        The wind is not an object like water. It is the movement of air, just like current is the movement of water. This movement of air is an ever-evolving phenomenon that can transform air into different forms and shapes. It can carry elements like water, sand or bigger objects to battle gravity. In Shape of Wind, the wind carries sound.

        Written for and dedicated to violinist Yu-Fang Chen, the pitch relationships in this piece reflect an interpretation of Yu-Fang’s name mapped to both the tempered and quarter-tone scales. The gestures are inspired by the shape of wind as elements are carried by the wind to create visuals like a tornado, a typhoon or a sand storm. This piece depicts the movement of wind sonically and gesturally.


        time, unfolding for large chamber ensemble	(Spring 2014)		– Chin Ting Chan

        time, unfolding was written for performance in the 70th Annual Composers Conference at Wellesley College. It explores the slow unfolding of musical materials and how it affects our perception of musical time. The idea of “unfolding time” manifests itself into the composition, and shapes the way it is structured in both the macro and micro levels. Ultimately, time is “unfolded” through the shape and movement that the music creates.

        This piece features five sections, resembling a symmetrical arch form. The beginning section is built upon three twelve-note chords multi-layered with micro-rhythmic activities. It uses a gradual contraction of harmonic rhythm to progress. The pitches used are often register-specific, and they occasionally extend to the upper registers to create a richer timbre. In the next section, this static atmospheric sonority is dissolved. A linear progression that finds its root from the preceding section becomes the focus. This part projects the static harmony to the foreground, where it becomes more present, with contrapuntal activities and intricate rhythmic interplays between instruments.
         
        The materials slowly migrate to a slower-paced passage that recalls the beginning texture. In this third section, the percussion and the piano resonate with the string harmonics and a mellow wind melody. A reverse process of materials soon follows. It allows the intricate activities to return, eventually building up to a final climax that has shimmering and brilliant textures, with the aid of aleatoric techniques. The work ends with the initial harmonic progression, combined with fragments of gestures from many previous sections.

        The use of serial procedures is prominent in this composition. The pitch materials are entirely generated from a twelve-tone row that is stated in its original form for the first time in the second section. The row is often divided into sub-sets, which are used in combinations on different pitch levels by multiplication of either themselves or other sets. Additionally, the vertical sonority is controlled by intervallic relationships found within the tone row. Using these serial techniques allows me to create a homogeneous harmonic language throughout the work and to maintain control over the degree of atonality.

        《時間‧伸展》於第70屆維斯里作曲家會議首演，作曲家嘗試以音樂素材各種的開展方式探討時間與聽覺的關係，並以此概念建構整首作品。 作品分成五大段，首段建基於三個由十二個音組成的和弦，它們在鬆緊拉扯之間制造張力，逐步把音樂推動至第二段，此時作品的旋律與節奏動機由不同的樂器呈現出來，樂器間緊密對應，此起彼落，形成活躍的多聲部織體，與先前成強烈對比，不過前段的素材亦不時重現，使兩段在對比之餘亦互為緊扣。 到了第三段，音樂仿似回到首段，但這次鋼琴與敲擊樂於背景以豐富的和聲配襯著弦樂與木管溫婉的旋律。此後，活潑的動機重現，線條再次彼此呼應，層層遞進，將音樂推至高潮，然後參差不齊的線條相繼消逝，最後以開首的和聲及一些樂句的重臨作結。


        Mirage for flute, clarinet in B-flat and percussion (Fall-Winter 2013) – Chin Ting Chan

        A mirage is an optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to form a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. The word also originates from the Latin word mirari, meaning “to look at, to wonder at.” The construction of this piece is partly inspired by the image of a mirage, in which the rapid succession of sound events represents imaginary displaced “objects” in a mirage. The result is a series of sonic mirages. Mirage is written for flute, clarinet in B-flat and percussion. It was commissioned by and dedicated to clarinetist Pei-Lun Tsai.


        re[sou]nding for marimba and piano (Fall 2013)			– Chin Ting Chan

        re[sou]nding is energetic and rhythmically charged. The word “resounding” means producing a resonant sound that has a long decay, which can be illustrated by the dissonant piano chords prolonged with repeated notes on the marimba, or with fast-running marimba passages filled with resonating piano interior sounds. The piece also features a wide range on both instruments. It explores the extremities of the instruments’ decay property and blending synergy.

        Taken out the letters “sou” from “resounding”, the word “rending” means tearing apart. This refers particularly to the middle section, with the collective pitches from the outer sections torn apart here in different ways, and subsequently reassembled to form contrasting harmonies and textures. The piece ends with additional repeated notes on the piano to create a reminiscence or echo effect of the similar sonority from the first section.


        Veiled Light for chamber ensemble (Summer-Fall 2013)		– Chin Ting Chan

        In the old days, landscape photographers sought for the highest quality in film by shooting slides. After processing such slides in laboratories, photographers view them either by using a slide projector, or setting them on top of a light source with a magnifier. The title of this piece refers to the covered light when viewing slides. Not only does the chemical used in the laboratories have a huge effect on the final color of the slides, the quality of the covered light is crucial as well. This idea of a “veiled” light represents images that the composer had in mind during the compositional process, and it metaphorically depicts the constantly changing instrumental timbre throughout the piece.

        Technically, Veiled Light explores the idea of expansion and contraction of a chord progression that, in time, governs the density and intensity of the music. This set of progression is derived from a series of harmonically saturated twelve-note chords. Through limiting and varying the interval classes used vertically within each of these chords, and planning the registral movement through the harmonic progression, the music is characterized with a gradual change of intensity. Transparency of instrumental timbre in the music also plays an important role within this complex harmonic structure.


        Crosswind for flute and alto saxophone (Spring 2013)		– Chin Ting Chan

        Commissioned by and written for the Tower Duo (Erin Helgeson Torres, flute; Michael Rene Torres, alto saxophone), Crosswind is a piece full of interactivity and energy. Both parts feature intricate gestures and timbral varieties that not only stimulate conversations, but also create a complex overall texture. While the two players sometimes complement each other, they are occasionally in conflict, each fighting for being the lead. To explore this idea of conflict and harmony, this piece alternates between materials that are vertically harmonious and vertically inharmonious, thus forming a progression of tension and release, as well as a collective sonority that is constantly developing, and often unexpected.


        tempora mutantur for clarinet in B-flat and live electronics (Spring 2013)

        “Tempora mutantur” is a Latin phrase meaning “the times are changed.” It is usually stated in a hexametric form, followed by another phrase “nos et mutamur in illis,” meaning “we too are changed in them.” This piece is one in a series of electroacoustic pieces relating to the motion of time and its effects on sounds. Aside from working primarily with time-based DSP effects, the idea of the motion of time is also prominent in how the composer systematically structured the composition in its harmonic content as well as its overall pace.

        This piece is commissioned by and written for clarinetist Pei-Lun Tsai. The fixed sample playbacks used are pre-recorded clarinet sounds and synthesized materials. Live processing techniques such as feedback delay, chorusing, flanging, harmonizer and granular synthesis are also employed throughout most of the sections.


        Whispers of Time for fixed media (Winter 2013) 			– Chin Ting Chan

        Whispers of Time is a 14-minute sonic exploration on the elapse of time, the stretch of time, and the reverse of time. Various sound samples have been manipulated and processed in ways that significantly affect the time domain of the samples, using mostly custom patches made with Cycling 74’s Max 6 program. 

        Throughout the composition, one hears layers of gestures move through a three-dimensional sonic space, emulating as well as alternating between hyper-real and surreal soundscapes. The multi-layer projection of the sound stage adds much depth to the music, and creates a sound world existed only in one’s imagination. The juxtaposition of contrasting events in various lengths eventually becomes an inspiration for the title.


        Shattered Wind for solo cello (Winter 2013) 			– Chin Ting Chan

        The wind has been a favorite subject in many Chinese poems and literature for centuries. Ancient poets and writers like to describe such phenomenon metaphorically as a power that brings and takes away things, or as decoration and accompaniment to the human emotion. In fact, the wind is mere physical movement of air particles, just like sound, except that sound is more subtle, and when there is a pattern, it creates pitches and excites a different part of our body, namely our ear. In this piece, I attempt to take on the role of the wind and describe such phenomenon in the spirits of the ancient Chinese poets and writers, with music.

        Shattered Wind is written for and commissioned by cellist Alvin Wong. The core pitch materials in this piece are sets of pentatonic scales. These pentatonic pitch collections are either used simultaneously or in rapid succession. The melody is often presented in fragments and is disguised by such collages and sequences of pitch collections.


        time, forward for piano and live electronics (Fall-Winter 2012) 	– Chin Ting Chan

        Written for pianist Kay (Yuan Yuan) He, time, forward explores my visions of time and the stretching of time through augmenting the sounds of a piano with live electronic processing. The performer often has the liberty to control the duration of the resonance of each sonority (resulting from the aleatoric notation), both reacting to and controlling the electronics. The title “time, forward” describes such interaction and the resulting momentum in the music. The fixed sample playbacks used are mostly pre-recorded sounds from inside the piano and live-recorded sounds. Live processing techniques such as feedback delay, chorusing, flanging, harmonizer and granular synthesis are used to enhance the harmonic spectrum as well as to stimulate conversations between the performer and the computer.


        Anemoi for flute/alto flute, oboe, clarinet in B-flat/bass clarinet, marimba and piano (Summer-Fall 2012)							– Chin Ting Chan

        In Greek mythology, Anemoi were gods of the winds. These gods, like many other gods, were portrayed as either winged or horse-like creatures with human faces. Anemoi mainly refers to the four directional winds including Boreas the North-Wind, Zephryos the West-Wind, Notos the South-Wind, and Euros the East-Wind. There are also four minor wind-gods from the north-west, north-east, south-west, and south-east.

        This piece borrows the name “Anemoi” to reflect the characteristics of the music, as well as the sounds resulting from its unique instrumentation. The symmetrical design of the pitch materials in horizontal succession and the stereophonic image on stage lend itself to a harmonic world that metaphorically depicts the direction of the winds. At times, the winds are in conflict (polyphony), or in harmony (homophony), but eventually, they tend to merge into the same direction (heterophony). Just like natural wind, they all become one in the end.


        …and see it vanish for clarinet in B-flat/bass clarinet, viola and cello (Summer 2012)
        – Chin Ting Chan

        The structure of …and see it vanish is highly linear in terms of pitch succession and rhythmic sequence. Bar lines are eliminated to give free flow to the music. It is meant not to have any clear and defined point of entrances and vanishing points for each instrument. They enter and interact freely with each other. When they vanish, they become transparent but still present, as if they have always been, and will forever continue to be.


        Icebergs for violin, cello and piano (Spring-Summer 2012) 		– Chin Ting Chan

        Icebergs are irregularly formed, just like almost everything in nature. But if you step back and look at them from a distance, you see a reflection from the water that creates perfectly symmetric images. Thus, asymmetry naturally creates symmetry in a macro point of view.

        Icebergs is written for a standard piano trio. This piece evokes transparent images of icebergs from different perspectives through the use of both symmetric and asymmetric musical structures in its macro and micro forms.

        像幾乎所有自然界的產物一樣，冰川的形成是不規則的。但是如果我們退後從一定距離觀看，會看到冰川的倒影與冰川本身形成完美對稱的圖像。因此，非對稱性從宏觀的角度創造了對稱性。

        《冰川》為鋼琴三重奏所作。此作品用對稱和非對稱的音樂结構，從宏觀與微觀多個不同的角度描繪了透明的冰川畫像。


        Moments for flute, cello, bass trombone and percussion (Winter-Spring 2012)
        – Chin Ting Chan
        I.	Allegro
        II.	Moderato; Asynchronous; Tempo primo
        III.	Più mosso
        IV.	Meno mosso

        Moments is written for bass trombonist J.J. Cooper. Initially, he asked for a chamber ensemble piece for three to seven instruments, with the intention to add music to the repertoire that features a bass trombone. The purpose is not to showcase the bass trombone’s soloistic capability, but to demonstrate that this instrument is able to perform as an equal member of a mixed ensemble. The idea of a multi-movement piece quickly came to my mind, where each movement (or one can conceive them as miniature pieces) captures a different moment of time, much like a photograph, or abstract images that seem to be familiar but hard to grasp.

        The first movement uses a vertically constructed sonority that is reinstated in fragments, and sustained through resonances of the instruments. The second movement is more linear in terms of the harmonic structure, and focuses on the transition between images. If the first movement is an image of a moment, the second movement would be layers of images of many moments. The third movement explores a wide frequency range; the instruments do not interact with each other, but play as if they are one instrument. The last movement is the most elaborate out of the four, where it shows off the virtuosity of the ensemble and its timbral possibility.

        The four instruments in this piece display four different voices/personalities. They can stand out as soloistic voices or blend in with each other. They are like layers of memory fragments. Sometimes, they are overlapped to create thicker layers; other times, they are simply separate and not interactive.


        Katachi IV for alto saxophone and live electronics (Spring 2012)	– Chin Ting Chan

        Katachi is a Japanese term that means form, shape or figure. In the ancient game of Go, the word Katachi is used to describe the formation of stones on a Go board (Go is originated from Ancient China, where it is known as Weiqi). The conception of stone formation in Go is transformed to apply to the circulation and combination of sounds and timbre in the music.

        Katachi IV is written for saxophonist Mark McArthur. It is an experiment on slow migration of timbre and color using a variety of techniques possible with the
        saxophone. The electronic echo contributes to this complex sonority by prolonging the decay and sustain of the sound. Most sections in this piece use an additive process to saturate the sound spectrum, much like the structure of a Go game, until the very end, where all complex sonorities dissolve into one.


        Stargaze for fixed media (Winter 2012)				– Chin Ting Chan

        Stargaze is realized using Cycling 74’s Max/MSP 5 program. The entire piece is generated with a sine wave running through various custom-made effect-processing modules; they include amplitude modulation, multi-tap/feedback delay, flanging, reverb, as well as pitch-shifting in the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform procedure. The piece is roughly divided into two parts. The first part uses the same pitch materials from Katachi II for violin and live electronics (2011), where they are solely derived from an ancient game of Go dated from 1846 in Japan. The second part groups the pitches in small sets, sometimes randomizes them and combines them with a quasi-glissando effect.


        Katachi III for trombone, piano and live electronics (Winter 2011)	– Chin Ting Chan

        Katachi is a Japanese term that means form, shape or figure. In the ancient game of Go, the word Katachi is used to describe the formation of stones on a Go board (Go is originated from Ancient China, where it is known as Weiqi). The conception of stone formation in Go is transformed to apply to the circulation and combination of sounds and timbre in the music.

        Katachi III is written for and dedicated to trombonist Kevin Fairbairn. The sounds used in this piece are those from the instruments and Go stones. Some of the live-electronic techniques include flanger, delay, ring modulation and transposer.


        Haengma for string quartet (Fall 2011) 				– Chin Ting Chan

        Haengma (행마/行馬) is a Korean word, which literally means “moving horse.” It is used in the game of Go to describe how the stones move on a Go board. (Go is originated from Ancient China, where it is known as Weiqi). There are different moves to connect stones across the Go board. Some of the connections are strong but slow, while others are just the opposite. For instance, placing stones right next to each other creates strong connections; therefore, these stones are more likely to “live” through invasions. Other moves such as the “two-space jump” or “diagonal jump” inflict larger influence across the Go board, but are more vulnerable to attacks. A Go player’s goal is to balance the moves accordingly and occupy more “territories” than his/her opponent. These concepts are borrowed to construct this piece, where intervals are chosen to create a balanced spectrum of tension and resolution. Go fights are often initiated by placing stones close to the opponents’, and they are symbolized by close intervals in the music, thus creating dispute and tension. Some Go games can end peacefully, while others do not without fights and sacrifices. What kind of a Go game does this piece represent?


        Katachi II for violin and live electronics (Spring 2011) 		– Chin Ting Chan

        Katachi is a Japanese term that means form, shape or figure. In the ancient game of Go, the word Katachi is used to describe the formation of stones on a Go board (Go is originated from Ancient China, where it is known as Weiqi). The conception of stone formation in Go is transformed to apply to the circulation and combination of sounds and timbre in the music.

        Katachi II is written for and dedicated to violinist Sally J. Williams. The sounds used in this piece are primarily generated from recorded sounds of the violin and the earlier piece Katachi I for fixed media. Electronic techniques that are employed in creating this piece include delay, ring modulation, flanger and more. The pitch materials are derived solely from an ancient game of Go dated from 1846 between two of Japan's top Go player Honinbo Shusaku and Genan Inseki - one of the most well-known game in the history that is also known as the "Ear-Raddening Game."


        Acoustic Field for flute, clarinet in B-flat, vibraphone, piano, violin and cello (Spring 2011)									– Chin Ting Chan

        The harmonic language of Acoustic Field is derived from, but not limited to Olivier Messiaen’s Modes of Limited Transposition. The chord structures are usually dense and complex – they explore the upper partials of the harmonic series. By stretching the harmony through time, it allows the acoustic space to develop and resonate, thus creating a colorful acoustic field.

        The piece is divided into three major sections. The first section explores the timbral variety of individual instruments. Thematic materials are often presented by solo or duet combinations with accompaniments. The middle section is marked with a metrically active rhythm, and is thematically developmental. The last section derives the harmony from the first section, but almost completely dissolves the other elements such as rhythm, texture and themes. The thematic materials are presented in fragments; the texture becomes denser and resembles that of the middle section; the stretching of the harmony is maximized, therefore creating a static acoustic field that serves to dissolve the complex harmony.


        Katachi I for fixed media (Spring 2011) 				– Chin Ting Chan

        Katachi is a Japanese term that means form, shape or figure. In the ancient game of Go, the word Katachi is used to describe the formation of stones on a Go board (Go is originated from Ancient China, where it is known as Weiqi). The conception of stone formation in Go is transformed to apply to the circulation and combination of sounds and timbre in the music.

        Katachi I uses primarily sounds produced by the Go stones, board and bowls. The circulating effect created by the different panning techniques is a dominant feature in this piece. The stereophonic image thus produced represents a recurring form or shape much similar to an image of a pentagon garden.


        …unfolding, from Trio for Violin, Clarinet and Marimba

        I have always tried to blend the sound of instruments from different families. In …unfolding, the clarinet is really a mediator that softens the sound of a violin, and sustains the decay of a marimba. This piece also calls for a bass clarinet for its low rumbling bass that fits particularly well with the low notes in marimba, and contrasts brilliantly with violin harmonics. With this combination of instruments, the music can span over five octaves with no limitation on legato, staccato, wide leaps or even frequent meter changes.

        Therefore, in addition to tone color, rhythm is my main focus for the first movement. There are many places throughout, where one instrument plays an ostinato in compound duple time, while the other instruments are playing in simple triple time. While the players have to maintain the pulse of the eighth notes, they must not be confused by the “tripletized” feeling of coming from a compound duple meter to a simple triple meter. The exchange of going back and forth from two eighth notes groups to three eighth notes groups is prominent throughout the entire composition. There are moments when one meter takes over our attention, but eventually, they all come together in a meter that compresses both groups in a total of five eighth notes.

        Now, notation is a problem. I have struggled to provide a score that is easiest to read without confusing the players. Instead of beaming everything in compound meters, I purposefully grouped them differently in their respective meters (without changing the time signature, however). If one sees three quarter notes in a compound duple meter, one immediately knows that he/she carries the rhythmic motive (and melodic motive due to the ascending fourths). This is also a way to avoid excessive ties.


        Awakening for trombone and live electronics (Winter 2010)	– Chin Ting Chan

        Awakening is written for and dedicated to trombonist Kevin Fairbairn. It uses Max/MSP as the main platform to trigger various sonic events, which include live-processings of the trombone sounds and pre-recorded trombone sounds that have been processed in a different program. This piece is a collage of sounds that explores the timbral variety of a trombone. It resembles morning horn/bell calls. The piece requires the performer to trigger different sonic events with a foot pedal. Improvisation plays a large role on the unfolding of the materials and the basic construction of the piece. The performer is often asked to respond to the electronics. Detailed instructions to run the Max/MSP patch have been included in the patch.


        Apparitions – a fantasy for chamber ensemble (Fall 2010-Spring 2011)

        Apparitions – a fantasy for chamber ensemble is scored for a chamber group that consists of flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone, two percussion, piano, two violins, viola, cello and double bass. The work has three major sections that loosely build an arch form. The beginning section explores how sound and timbre are gradually transformed through different means of harmonic progression and orchestration. The middle section is vivid and rhythmic, with frequently changing meters. The last section extensively utilizes aleatoric technique. Throughout the work, various melodic and harmonic motives tie the sections together.

        The piece is essentially an abstract sonic representation of how I envision apparitions–ghostly figures that represent the human imagination of the afterlife. They are often invisible, but are traditionally imagined or perceived as human-like figures that can suddenly appear. Many people claim to have seen apparitions, but their actual existence is yet to be proven. This mystery has inspired me to write music that is transparent and glassy. In Apparitions, pairs of half-steps in the high register circle through the ensemble and portray the transparency of apparitions and their movement through time and space. A set of returning chord progression represents the appearance of apparitions.

        The word “apparitions” has been used as a title for pieces by composers such as György Ligeti and George Crumb. While my work has no connection to theirs, it is influenced by them to a certain extent. I have learned how Crumb’s sense of time, space and resonance dominants his thinking, and how Ligeti’s sophisticated use of rhythm often governs the form of his compositions. Other influences have come from Tōru Takemitsu’s colorful orchestration and Witold Lutosławski’s absolute control of the aleatoric technique.

        Improvisations for live, interactive electronics (Fall 2010)		– Chin Ting Chan

        Improvisations is an interactive electroacoustic piece written for computer, and a performer who is instructed to trigger various audio events through pressing different keys on the keyboard. The piece was realized using Cycling 74’s Max/MSP program.


        Five Songs of the Von Seggerns for soprano, clarinet in B-flat and piano
        I.	“Immortality” 					(Winter-Summer 2010)
        II.	“How Can I Keep from Singing?”
        III.	“He Grew in Those Seasons like Corn in the Night”
        Interlude – “Silent Night”
        IV.	“Experiments in Silence”
        V.	“Aftermath”

        On the Christmas day of 1925, five members of the Von Seggern family of Wisner were killed instantly in a rail crossing tragedy in Nebraska. The car that the victims were in was completely racked and torn apart. The family members included the father and mother, Fred and Lena, two daughters, Anna and Louisa, and a son, Gustave. At the day of the funeral services, the other son – the lone survivor, 19-year-old boy Fred Von Seggerns Jr.’s physical condition was surprisingly well, but he was still under the impression that he was injured in a football game, without knowing that his loved ones were dead.

        The time span in Ms. DeBoer’s poems is set before and after the train crash. They try to capture the different characters of the tragic family either from the perspectives of the individuals or a third-person perspective. Also, most of the poems somehow incorporate theatrical elements as an expressive tool. Few of them even have literal descriptions of atmospheric settings to enhance the drama.

        “Immortality” depicts the everyday life of Fred Von Seggern Sr. He is portrayed as a hard working farmer. The form is almost through-composed with no obvious repeated sections. It goes well with how the poem transforms using movement and time. Fred Von Seggern Sr.’s music is thus atmospheric and yet full of inner expression and drama.

        “How Can I Keep from Singing?” is a dynamic contrast to “Immortality”. From the eyes of the wife, Lena Von Seggern sees a violent and abusive husband. The music deals with tension and release. It goes from very dense and rhythmic to more melodic and calm. The pronoun, “He” can also symbolize death itself. Note also how Ms. DeBoer spaced out the words.

        “He Grew in Those Seasons like Corn in the Night” portrays Fred Von Seggerns Jr. the farmer, and also, through his eyes is the description of his father, in which it sets up a powerful contrast to Lena Von Seggern’s “How Can I Keep from Singing?” There is also an interesting relationship to “Immortality”, with the similar setting of sunset and the use of colors in words. The symbolism of his father and God and the biblical quotations eventually sets up the atmosphere for the unresolved tension at end.

        The Interlude uses the Christmas melody “Silent Night,” originally by Franz Xaver Gruber (1787-1863), as a basic melodic framework, and adds pitches that eventually evolve into dense clusters. The Interlude hints at the Christmas day of 1925, and serves as a divider between before and after the accident.

        The next song, “Experiments in Silence” describes the surrounding atmosphere of a funeral service and emotion that arises from inside the coffin – silently laid inside is the dead girl – the daughter, Louisa Von Seggern. The pastor opens the lid, and Louisa “answers” his prayer “with eternal silence.” This song starts with a large bell that resembles a church. Different sounds from the piano’s interior are used as a metaphor to the coffin, with the most evoking moment being at the end, where Ms. DeBoer writes, “in silence they fasten the lid to my eternity.”

        The lone survivor Fred Von Seggerns Jr. feels no less desperate than her dead sister. “Aftermath” portrays the emotion of the 19-year-old boy sitting in a hospital after having realized the death of his loved ones. The energetic rhythm depicts the tension in Fred’s anguished heart, and tries to capture his obscure remembrance of the rhythm and horror that comes from the vital train.


        Oceanus for fixed media (Spring 2010)				– Chin Ting Chan

        In Greek Mythology, Oceanus was portrayed as a Titan. As one of the many sons of Uranus and Gaia, he was believed to be a river that encircles the world. I borrowed the name Oceanus for this piece to depict water in a natural environment. This piece is roughly divided into three sections. The first section consists of only sounds of water. The sound of the rain and a non-processed thunder strike mark the beginning of the second section, which also feature a multitude of animal sounds. The last section incorporates combination of sounds from both previous sections.


        Zone 23 for fixed media (Spring 2010)				– Chin Ting Chan

        Zone 23 is my sonic representation of a place at war. The piece begins with a resonant chord, which often comes back throughout in order to connect the different sections together. The piece features mostly sounds that pertain to the idea of modern war - for example, sounds of helicopter, gunfire, bombs among others. The middle section features the juxtapositions of animal and bullet sounds, with a person steadily stepping in the background. It can be interpreted as the person witnessing a war from a distant, as if he/she is not involved or affected.


        Of Metals and Electrons for fixed media (Spring 2010)		– Chin Ting Chan

        I have always been fascinated by the sound of electricity and how it is consistently present in our everyday lives without us noticing them. A “silent” room with any object that can transfer currency is never truly silent. There is always an extremely high frequency that is, though normally unnoticeable and unseen, it is surprisingly present and “loud” if one really focuses his/her attention on listening to the sound. In my imagination, the invisible electrons can then be seen as they flow through the air molecules and other substances.

        The closest sound that I can associate to the sound I have described above is the resonant of any metal, which to me, creates some very high overtones that approximate the sonic images of my “loud” room. To make a connection, metal is a conductor that can effectively transfer electric currency, and this is the theme to my Of Metals and Electrons. This piece contains metal sounds that are stretched and layered, with which emerges a narrative that guides the listeners through these invisible sounds.


        Three Episodes (Winter 2010)					– Chin Ting Chan
        I.	Bird Songs
        II.	The Destruction
        III.	Glass Fantasy

        Three Episodes contains a set of three short pieces that use different sounds pertaining to specific themes or narrations.

        Bird Songs creates an impression of being surrounded in an environment of distorted or twisted bird sounds. When listening, one should focus on his/her attention how the timbres of varies bird sounds are manipulated and presented.

        The Destruction is a narration of forest destruction. The piece uses sounds that have connections to the wood and forest, like tree, tree falling, stepping on branches, saw, fire among others.

        Glass Fantasy utilizes mostly sounds of glasses and water. It focuses mainly on the timbres of the sources and how, in result, an interesting harmonic rhythm is created through the usages of stereophonic images.


        Fanfare for Brass and Percussion (Winter 2009)			– Chin Ting Chan

        Commissioned by conductor Jason Thorpe Buchanan, Fanfare for Brass and Percussion is a piece full of drama and energy. It begins with a very rhythmic section by the percussion, while the brass accompanies with an almost chaconne-like progression. The brass chorale gradually becomes more prominent and eventually builds up to several semi-climaxes. The first trumpet then introduces the main theme.

        The timpani plays a leading role in this piece, especially in transitions and whenever the drama needs to be intensified. The middle section combines fixed rhythmic and melodic materials with aleatoric composition technique. The percussion plays driving ostinati that provide the rhythmic pulse and energy. Like the beginning, the brass chorale grows out of a climax, almost seamlessly. The main theme is once again presented, but with slight variations.


        Saxophone Quartet (Fall 2009)					– Chin Ting Chan

        [To me, a saxophone quartet is one giant versatile instrument. With the technical ability of the saxophones, this chamber ensemble really enables me to write all kinds of difficult mixed rhythms, and the players can usually tackle them with great precision. Writing versatile pieces also compensates for the fact that the saxophone quartet lacks the color variety that one might find in, say, a woodwind quartet. But on the other hand, the color similarity or limitation of the saxophones can enhance line continuity.]

        The Saxophone Quartet consists of three main sections. The first section is in mixed meter with featured solo lines for the players. The next section transits to a steadier quadruple meter and introduces a slow theme with flourish running sixteenth notes. There are two small chorale sections within that serve to counterbalance the energy of the running sixteenth notes, which also prepare for the return of the beginning section. Eventually, an outburst of the flourish line brings the piece to a furious end.


        Five Etudes for Solo Piano (Fall 2009)				– Chin Ting Chan
        I.	Rhapsody
        II.	Bird Songs
        III.	Ostinato and Invention
        IV.	Detuned Melody
        V.	Earth Dance

        The Five Etudes for Solo Piano are highly individual and virtuosic pieces for the piano. Each etude describes the given title both musically and visually. These etudes can be played separately, but preferably in a set.

        The first etude, Rhapsody, has the characteristic of a “recitative”; the piano presents melodies that are rhapsodic, almost timeless that imitates the soloist in an opera. The stubborn major 2nd interval that is often present, serves to tie the whole piece together.

        Bird Songs presents a series of precisely notated rhythms and note patterns that unfold and vary in different forms throughout. Fermatas are used to control sustain and silence. They vary in length at the performer’s discretion. In this piece, the “melody” is often announced with octave displacement and transposition in order to experiment with the full possibility of timbre and texture.

        Ostinato and Invention focuses on polytonality and canon. The lower voice begins a half step below the upper voice. As the piece proceeds, the lower voice comes closer to the tonality of the upper voice, and eventually ends in a “true” canon.

        Detuned Melody presents a jazzy melody that is often interrupted by densely chromatic alterations that attempt to “detune” the melody. As the music gets more and more dissonant, the main theme becomes disguised or flipped. It is left to the audience to decide whether it is a successful “detuning” or not.

        Earth Dance is influenced by György Ligeti’s “Études pour piano no. 3 – Touches bloquées.” Ligeti apparently borrowed the idea of movable key blocks from Henning Siedentopf’s essay, “Neue Wege der Klaviertechnik.” The silently depressed keys in one hand make some of the same notes played by the other hand silent, and thus interrupt the continuous lines. Because the skipped notes are irregularly placed in the measures, a passage with continuous eighth notes would end up sounding like those with combinations of compound and simple meters. Also, the use of the lower part of the keyboard adds energy, thickness, aggressiveness and earthiness to this piece. This etude ends the set furiously with a percussive chord in the lowest register of the piano.


        Elegy for Clarinet and Piano (Spring/Fall 2009)			– Chin Ting Chan

        I began composing Elegy for Clarinet and Piano during the spring of 2009, but put aside due to other projects. Coming back to it is a very refreshing experience.

        This piece’s harmonic language experiments with intervals of seconds and their respective inversions and octave displacements. With the sustained quality of the melody and the clarinet itself, the changes of intervals are almost seamless. Both textural and timbral changes are perceived gradually, for the piano is treated as a sustained instrument as well.

        Never percussive, Elegy for Clarinet and Piano sings a wave of sound that denotes moments of reflections and introspections. It is my different approach to what an “elegy” usually is.


        Transfiguration for viola and harp (Fall 2008)			– Chin Ting Chan

        In Transfiguration, the relationship of the two instruments is never melody-accompaniment. Instead, the fact that they blend very well together enables me to look at them as one instrument. While the viola can sustain the decay of the harp, the harp strengthens the viola pizzicato and provides harmonies and thus chord progressions.

        Transfiguration consists of melodies that keep changing their forms, which makes the structure of this composition a long development or even “themes and variations,” with themes that never appear again in their original forms.


        Caprice for String Quartet (Spring 2007/Fall 2008)			– Chin Ting Chan

        The Caprice for String Quartet is meant to be heard without the boundaries of barlines. A highly energetic work, the rhythmic pulse is frequently obscured by off-beat accents and time signature changes. With the constant shifting rhythmic pulse, this piece is an experiment in rhythmic tension and how it interferes with musical phrases.

        The main theme is initially presented on the off-beat, which creates an ambiguous and unsettled feeling that eventually develops into different fugal sections. The second theme is announced by steady beats from the cello. This more lyrical theme eventually lends itself to an elaborate development, which is frequently disturbed when combined with the unison motive from the beginning.

        At last, the main theme returns and presents itself confidently on the downbeat. The composition ends with three violent chords, which serves to affirm the concluding simple meter.


        Duo for Two Flutists (Fall 2008)					– Chin Ting Chan

        I am always fascinated by the agility flutes can provide. In Duo for Two Flutists, the title with the word “flutists” enables me to also call for another kind of flute – piccolo, which is even more agile than the flute – with the different timbre, higher energy output and more airy sound on the low registers, the piccolo, to me, provides a more direct and almost shrill sound quality that is so unique, especially when it is played on the extreme high harmonics.

        This piece is in an obscured rondo form with ideas overlapping the sections in order to hide the double barlines, and thus creates as seamless transitions as possible. All three of the octatonic scales are employed here to create this exotic yet idiosyncratic flute sound.


        Trio for Violin, Clarinet and Marimba (Fall-Winter 2008)		– Chin Ting Chan
        I.	Vivace
        II.	Tranquillo
        III.	Finale

        I have always tried to blend the sound of instruments from different families. In Trio for Violin, Clarinet and Marimba, the clarinet is really a mediator that softens the sound of a violin, and sustains the decay of a marimba. I have chosen the clarinet in A because of the slight darker color than the Bb clarinet in addition to the lower possible notes. This piece also calls for a bass clarinet for its low rumbling bass that fits particularly well with the low notes in marimba, and contrasts brilliantly with violin harmonics. With this combination of instruments, the music can span over five octaves with no limitation on legato, staccato, wide leaps or even frequent meter changes.

        Therefore, in addition to tone color, rhythm is my main focus for the first movement. There are many places throughout, where one instrument plays an ostinato in compound duple time, while the other instruments are playing in simple triple time. While the players have to maintain the pulse of the eighth notes, they must not be confused by the “tripletized” feeling of coming from a compound duple meter to a simple triple meter. The exchange of going back and forth from two eighth notes groups to three eighth notes groups is prominent throughout the entire composition. There are moments when one meter takes over our attention, but eventually, they all come together in a meter that compresses both groups in a total of five eighth notes.

        Now, notation is a problem. I have struggled to provide a score that is easiest to read without confusing the players. Instead of beaming everything in compound meters, I purposefully grouped them differently in their respective meters (without changing the time signature, however). If one sees three quarter notes in a compound duple meter, one immediately knows that he/she carries the rhythmic motive (and melodic motive due to the ascending fourths). This is also a way to avoid excessive ties.

        The second movement is an interlude or perhaps a reflective moment. Rhythm becomes static with the marimba playing parallel quartal harmonies throughout. Exchanging thematic materials back and forth between the violin and the clarinet is indeed treating the two instruments as one with the advantages of both. The second movement flows like there will be no end.

        In an attempt to capture the essence of the first movement and conclude what is left behind from the second, the third movement brings back the overall idea of rhythmic ambiguity from the first movement. I have incorporated various fugal sections with subjects that avoid any rhythmic cadence. The seemingly simple but ongoing quarter and eight notes obscure any sense of strong or weak beats, which in effect eliminate feelings of particular time signatures, and ultimately move the music forwards. After the fugal sections, the clarinet announces a reminiscence of the first movement in this however slower tempo; but soon after, a metric modulation is employed, where the main theme of the first movement is heard again in the original tempo, before all three instruments eventually burst into a furious end.


        Symphonic Movements for orchestra (Spring-Fall 2008)		– Chin Ting Chan
        I.	Lento
        II.	Largo
        III.	Grand

        The Symphonic Movements is a three-movement work scored for a standard symphony orchestra. The first movement starts with tubular bells, a vibraphone, harp and a solo violin. The percussive sound of the first three instruments is sustained by the violin harmonic, which carries over to the string sections, and starts off the piece like a wave of sound. It is not until the second time when the winds announce the first theme again that the sound becomes more solid. When the brass joins in, they work towards the first climax, where the Bb bass finally resolves to an Eb; however, due to its diminished quality, the tension has not yet been resolved.

        Followed by an arrival of Ab major tonality, the energy and tension temporarily die away in this calm and reflective middle section, where various instruments play the rhythmic motive of the first theme. This section then slowly leads us to a second climax. After a brief timpani solo, the same instruments announce the return of the beginning wave of sound with the first theme’s absence. After an altered and more chromatic restatement of the second climax material, this movement finally ends on an answering Eb major chord.

        The second movement is a meditative movement. It starts off with a large gong that passes off its sound to the string section. The entire piece is dominated by suspensions of different kinds. Sometimes, they are resolved, while many times they are not. With the almost always present perfect 5th pedal with violin II pizzicato and harp, the piece is static and evolving at the same time. I think of this movement as a huge hairpin that stretches over seven minutes, and when the wind and brass sections join in, the climatic effect is profound. After huge tutti climaxes, the suspended string sound comes back, and ends the movement with open-strings pizzicati. This movement conveys a feeling of large space and breath. The almost obsessive perfect 5th pedal, highly influenced by Maurice Ravel’s Le Gibet, is not explained until the next movement.

        After the second movement, which is essentially an interlude, the third movement is really a continuation of the first movement, for it starts like how it ended. Nonetheless, we are in an entirely new key – the suspended key from the second movement. After all these questionings, the apparent suspended notes are indeed anticipations. This last movement uses primarily motivic materials from the first movement, and it is very episodic. The rather melodic and soloistic materials in the middle section showcase how the instruments pass long melodies within the orchestra and how they connect their breaths and phrases. A string trio is used here to achieve a chamber effect.

        This middle section is embodied by two large and elaborated fugal sections that feature primarily the triplet motive. With occasional meter changes, the fugal sections provide us unlimited energy that is to end the entire piece brilliantly in Eb with the “suspended” notes as extensions to the chord.


        Symphonic Movements for orchestra (Spring-Fall 2008) (ver. 2)	– Chin Ting Chan
        I.	Lento
        II.	Largo
        III.	Grand

        The first movement starts with tubular bells, a vibraphone, harp and a solo violin. The percussive sound of the first three instruments is sustained by the violin harmonic, which carries over to the string sections, and starts off the piece like a wave of sound. There are several climaxes in the middle, and they work towards a return of the beginning wave of sound announced by the same instruments. This time, however, the first theme is absent. After an altered and more chromatic restatement of the slow section’s material, this movement finally ends on an answering major chord.

        The second movement is meditative and conveys a feeling of large space and breath. The almost obsessive perfect 5th pedal throughout the movement is highly influenced by Maurice Ravel’s Le Gibet. It is not explained until the next movement.

        After the second movement, which is essentially an interlude, the third movement is really a continuation of the first movement, for it starts like how it ended. Nonetheless, we are in an entirely new key – the suspended key from the second movement. The middle section is surrounded by two large and elaborated fugal sections that feature primarily the triplet motive.


        Suite for Solo Cello (Fall 2007-Spring 2008)			– Chin Ting Chan
        I.	Prelude: Molto Appassionato
        II.	Fuga: Allegretto
        III.	Scherzo: Espressivo, rubato
        IV.	Caprice: Lively
        V.	Muted: Fantasia
        VI.	Dance: Energetic

        When one thinks about composing a cello suite, inevitably, he/she has to look at J. S. Bach’s set of six cello suites. With them, the master defined the genre. After Bach, there comes one of the most successful collaboration of music history – Benjamin Britten and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. It is in Britten’s scores that I found my direct model or guide. Written for and dedicated to cellist Cole Tutino, the Suite for Solo Cello explores the possibility of cello as a solo instrument, and challenges the player’s abilities on different aspects of cello techniques including double and triple-stops, harmonics and more.

        The Prelude attempts to set the ground for the following movements, it is a rather rhapsodic piece. I have made used of mostly the lower and more resonant registers of the cello. With double and triple-stops on that register, the listeners immediately notice the richness of the cello, and are amazed by the strong overtones it can produce. This invites the listeners to hear a cello ensemble instead of a soloist. Besides, the piece is very chromatic; one should focus on the return of gestures or rhythmic pulses instead of melodies in order to follow with the imagination of the cellist.

        The Fuga contains three major fugal sections. The most challenging task here is the voice independence. With only one bow and four-strings and the many possibilities of double and triple-stops, the cello is limited to produce only two-part counterpoint most of the time. The even harder part is that fugues work most efficiently with different rhythms in different voices. How do we distinguish the voices? My solution for the player and listeners is to always listen to the dotted quarter notes that are slurred to eighth notes.

        Marked “Expressivo, rubato” as tempo markings, the Scherzo is much like an improvisation. Several fragmented materials from the first two movements are presented here - noticeably the dotted rhythm. This movement challenges the performer’s imagination. It also foresees and prepares for what comes next.

        The music continues and leads into the Caprice without a break. The pentatonic and open-strings pizzicati really explore and showcase the fullness of the sound of a cello. On the other hand, the successive wide-leaps, rapid and articulated passages display the agility of a cello. The full resonant sound near the end reminds us the second movement, and this movement ends on E-A-D (from low to high). Maybe after all, it sounds like string bass?

        Muted is a movement of breath-taking intensity. Much like the Scherzo, this movement contains a melody of improvisatory nature with a different timbre due to the mute. The snap pizzicato at the end prepares for the energy to come.

        The previous movements mostly showcase the agility, fullness, color and timbre of a cello. To balance and sum up the Suite for Solo Cello, the Dance is a movement that displays fully the rhythmic and percussive ability of a cello. The entire movement is based on a variation of a 3+3+2 rhythm. With occasional additions or omissions of eighth or quarter notes, this movement always provides energy and moves forwards. The work ends with a series of open-strings left-hand pizzicati followed by a few double, triple and quadruple-stops, just like how it begins.


        Fantasy for Solo B-flat Clarinet (Fall 2007)				– Chin Ting Chan

        Written for and dedicated to clarinetist Eliza Brown, the Fantasy for Solo B-flat Clarinet is a self-contained, rather elaborate solo piece. The B-flat clarinet is really three instruments combined. The rumbling bass at the lower register differs significantly from the sweet, pure and gentle middle voice. The high and screaming upper register is no less interesting than the other two lower “instruments.”

        It is always a challenge to write for a solo instrument, especially with one that carries so many possibilities. While I have to think about exploring the different timbres possible of the clarinet, I also need to plan carefully for the free rhythmic flow of the piece as the solo clarinet is not playing against or with any instrument.

        Throughout the piece, I have learned to turn my attention from vertical chordal harmony to individual voice leading. Every interval between the notes is carefully planned, so that one feels cohesiveness and organism within the composition. At this point, I consider that the clarinet is harmonizing itself although it is a strict monophonic instrument.

        There are two different themes, and very often, the melodic ideas overlap with each others. This piece is an attempt to write out my completely free and rhapsodic imagination.


        Trio for Horn, Cello and Piano (Fall 2007)				– Chin Ting Chan

        The conventional instrumentation for a horn trio is with a violin and a piano. Among the great composers who wrote with this instrumentation were Johannes Brahms, and, close to a hundred years later, György Ligeti. Evidently, there were not many attempts on this combination throughout the history. The primary reason for this, I believe, is that the horn and the violin really do not blend together quite well. The cello, however, has a fuller sound that is capable of embracing the horn’s sound as opposed to a violin, which often sticks out in this combination.

        Commissioned by hornist Micheal Walker, the Trio for Horn, Cello and Piano is my attempt to create a new trio combination. Throughout the piece, you will hear a primary melodic motive, which is introduced by the piano at first, passing on to the other two instruments. Occasionally, the motive is hidden, overlapped (stretto), transposed, augmented or even inverted. The slow section is a reminiscence of Claude Debussy’s “The Sunken Cathedral.” After a dissonant “call” from the piano and the cello, the piece is interrupted by a violent third theme. The themes come back several times and are altered every time. If there is a form to this piece, it is “continuous development.”

        The attempt to incorporate the primary melodic motive into three different sections of the piece is my major task for this piece.


        Woodwind Quintet in C (Spring/Fall 2007)				– Chin Ting Chan
        I.	Allegro
        II.	Largo
        III.	Theme and Variations
        IV.	Allegro

        I always love the combination of a woodwind quintet. The variety of color and timbre in this ensemble is vast, and because of that, it is enormously effective to let every voice speak out at different moments. An exact same melody repeated five times with different instruments or combinations of them can sound refreshing and interesting. To me, this comes to be the most fun part composing for this ensemble.

        Written for the composition reading session of spring 2007 at San José State University, the first movement was meant to be a stand-alone piece; it is thus rather cohesive and self-contained. The piece was composed during a time when I was fascinated by fugues; I treasured every opportunity to incorporate fugal sections into my compositions. The quintet, as you would expect, ended up extremely contrapuntal.

        After a vigorous of energy and complexity presented in the first movement, the second movement is an attempt for a calm and peaceful afterthought. The slow theme from the first movement reappears and is further decorated and explored. Smooth color and timbre changes and full ensemble sound are major explorations in this movement.

        The third movement is my attempt with a rather free formal structure. It contains sets of variations on a theme. Very often, I vary on only fragments of the theme. When I do present the entire theme, it becomes a fugal subject against the second theme from the first movement. Overall, it is a set of variations that continuously evolves, and finally ends on running sixteenth notes that are once only accompaniments.

        Started with stating the main theme from the first movement, the fourth movement is a sonata-allegro movement that combines three major fugal sections. Each of the fugal section combines new materials and themes or varied themes from the previous movements. The “development” of this movement is written to showcase the soloistic abilities of each player.


        String Quartet in A minor (Fall 2006)				– Chin Ting Chan

        The String Quartet in A minor is my first attempt on a large scale work using strict classical technique. The beginning of the piece features a dissonant introduction before the “exposition” begins. The influence by Wolfgang Mozart’s so-called “Dissonance String Quartet” is prominent in here. The piece is also in Sonata-Allegro form – a form that was the norm of music during the Classical era.

        Though classically influenced, the harmony employed here is way beyond the predecessors’. The melodies found in this piece are very motivic-based. The primary motive – an ascending minor chord, is frequently altered to construct this highly contrapuntal composition.
